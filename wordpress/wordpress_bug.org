First do not use 777, change it back to 755.
Second you need to add the proper group permissions most likely to the same that Apache is running under. To find that out try:
#+begin_src <sh>
ps aux | grep apache 
#+end_src
You will see the Apache user group on the left.
Now change your WordPress folder to the same user group, you can do this in a parent folder or sub folder but for sanity it usually best for parent folder, use -R to recursively do it.
#+begin_src <sh>
chown -R www-data:www-data /path/to/wp-root-folder
#+end_src
