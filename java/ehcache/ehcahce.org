* ehcahe is thread safe api
[[https://github.com/ehcache/ehcache3/issues/1188][refer git conclusion]]
I can't find acquireWriteLockOnKey in ehcache3.x api. So,
 ehcache3.x do not need lock explicitly when put element in multithread env?

Hi,
There is no need for explicit locking and there was none in Ehcache 2.x
even. Both are thread safe libraries with regards to cache operations.
The explicit locking API from Ehcache 2.x was promoting the wrong kind of
patterns and thus we have decided to not reproduce it in Ehcache 3.x.

Louis
