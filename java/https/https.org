* shared cookie between subdomains (web1.aa.com, web2.aa.com)
** reason 
 Then the cookie won't be sent for requests to mydomain.com. However if you use the following, it will be usable on both domains:
 Set-Cookie: name=value; domain=mydomain.com
 In RFC 2109, a domain without a leading dot meant that it could not be used on subdomains, and only a leading dot (.mydomain.com) would allow it to be used across subdomains.
 However, modern browsers respect the newer specification RFC 6265, and will ignore any leading dot, meaning you can use the cookie on subdomains as well as the top-level domain.
** add cookie to HttpResponse from java code
 Cookie cookie = new Cookie("myCookie", "myValue");
 cookie.setMaxAge(60 * 60);
 cookie.setDomain(".myserver.com"); 
 resposne.add(cookie);
