* Binding time
** Compile time
   - define
     - Compile decide the memory location in where.
   - defect
     1. Initial location of program  is fixed.
     2. not support Relocation.
	
** memory allocation method
  - linking loader decide the location.
  - adv:
    - support Relocation
  - defect
    - Loading model that is not required  cause waste of time and memory.
    - Model with great amount fuctions need more time and memory when loading.
    
*

** Execution Time(Dynamic Binding)
   - The location is decided at Execution time. 
   - Need extra device to support
     - A Base Register store the base address.
     - Physical address = base address + Local Address.
   - adv
     - high flexibility
   - defect
     1. bad performance

* Memory allocation

** Mthod:
 - First-Fit
 - Best-Fit
 - Worst-Fit
 - Next-Fit
** Compare four allocation method

| 0         | Time | Time Utility |
|-----------+------+--------------|
| Firt-Fit  | fine | fine         |
|-----------+------+--------------|
| Best-Fit  | bad  | fine         |
|-----------+------+--------------|
| Worst-Fit | bad  | bad          |
|-----------+------+--------------|
| Next-Fit  | fine | fine         |
|-----------+------+--------------|

* external fragment
    - 

  - In contaguous method, when Sum of Fress block size >= Process required size
    But Free blocak is not contiguous, free sapce can not be allocated for proccess.

  - First/best/worst/next fit all cause external fragment.

  - solution
    - Compatioc:
      - gater free spaces into Big contiguous free space.
      - defect
	- It is hard  to find a stratege to gather free space in short time.
	- need Dynamic Binding support.

* Page Memory Management
 - Physical memory divide into n equal size,Frame.
 - Logical memory dived into many Page as possible.
 - Page size = Frame size
** allocation
 - OS give  frames that n*frame >= n*Page
 - non-contifuous allocation
**  adv
 - slove exteranl fragment
 - support share memory
 - support to make dynamic loading and Virtual memory.
**  defect
 - internal fragment
 - longer time to access memory.(spending on looking inquire Page table)
 - require extra device support(Page table)

* Internal fragment
    - Frame size > page size;
* Page Table
* Segment Memory management
 - pysical memory is NOT divided into smallspace.
 - Logical memory is divided into Segments that vary in size.
** what is Segment?
 - main
 - subroutine
 - data section
** ADV
1.  no Internal fragment.
2. support sharing memory and protection
   - It is easier to do than page management.
** Defect
1. External fragment
2. longer time to access memory.
3. need extra device support.
